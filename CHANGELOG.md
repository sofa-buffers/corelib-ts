# Changelog

All notable changes to `@sofa-buffers/corelib` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the version is below `1.0.0`, breaking changes bump the **minor** version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Opt-in decode limits (corelib-ts#38).** A new optional `DecodeLimits`
  options object — `{ maxArrayCount?, maxStringLen?, maxBlobLen? }` — is accepted
  by every decode entry point: `decode(bytes, visitor, limits?)`, the `IStream`
  constructor, and the `Cursor` constructor. When set, an array count or string /
  blob byte length that exceeds the cap is rejected at the field's header —
  before the array is sized or any payload is decoded / streamed to the visitor —
  with the new `SofabErrorCode.LimitExceeded` (`"LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`). The decoder
  never clamps or truncates. `LimitExceeded` is deliberately distinct from
  `InvalidMsg`: exceeding a receiver-configured limit is *policy*, not wire
  malformation — the identical bytes decode fine under a looser limit. **Default:
  no limits (today's behavior); the corelib invents no default cap** — the values
  come from the sofabgen config, baked into generated code (generator#102). Also
  hardens `Cursor` so a wire array `count` larger than the bytes remaining is
  rejected as `Incomplete` before `new Array(count)` is sized, so a hostile count
  can never drive an allocation larger than the input.
- **Finish-less three-valued decode outcome (MESSAGE_SPEC §7).** Truncation — a
  decode that ends *inside* a field — is now a distinct outcome from a malformed
  message. New `SofabErrorCode.Incomplete` (`"INCOMPLETE"`) and a `DecodeStatus`
  enum (`Complete` / `Incomplete` / `Invalid`) are exported. Every one-shot
  truncation site (`decode()`, `Cursor`) that used to throw `INVALID_MSG` — an
  unterminated varint, a payload / array shorter than its declared length, or a
  nested sequence left open at end-of-buffer — now throws `INCOMPLETE` instead;
  genuinely malformed input (varint over 64 bits, bad subtype/length/count, id
  over max, dangling sequence-end, over-`MAX_DEPTH` nesting) still throws
  `INVALID_MSG`. Mirrors corelib-go#42.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (decode API):** there is no finish/finalize step. `IStream.end()`
  no longer throws to promote an incomplete stream to an error; it is now a pure
  accessor returning `DecodeStatus.Complete` when the stream ended on a field
  boundary or `DecodeStatus.Incomplete` when it ended inside one. A malformed
  message still throws from `IStream.feed()`. Callers that relied on `end()`
  throwing on truncation must check its return value instead.
- **BREAKING (wire format):** a fixlen array (`fp32`/`fp64`) now always carries
  its `fixlen_word` — even when empty (`element_count == 0`). Previously an empty
  fixlen array was `[header][count=0]` with no `fixlen_word`, making an empty
  `fp32` array byte-identical to an empty `fp64` one (`05 00`); a decoder could
  not tell them apart. An empty fixlen array is now
  `[header][count=0][fixlen_word]` with no payload (`05 00 20` for `fp32`,
  `05 00 41` for `fp64`), so the element subtype stays recoverable. Integer
  arrays (`u8`…`u64`, `i8`…`i64`) are unchanged — they never carry a
  `fixlen_word` — so an empty integer array stays `[header][count=0]`. Mirrors
  CORELIB_PLAN §4.8 / MESSAGE_SPEC §3 and corelib-c-cpp#45.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

A performance release: the encode and decode hot paths no longer churn
short-lived `BigInt` objects, which V8 profiling identified as the dominant
cost. The wire format is unchanged and all shared conformance vectors still
pass. One source-level breaking change to the decode `Visitor` enables the
decode-side win.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `Visitor.unsigned`, `Visitor.signed`, `Visitor.arrayUnsigned`,
  and `Visitor.arraySigned` now receive `value: number | bigint` instead of
  `bigint`. Integer values are delivered **number-first** — a `number` when the
  value fits exactly (`≤ 2^53 − 1`, covering field ids, `u8`…`u32` and small
  `u64`/`i64` values) and a `bigint` only beyond that. This avoids a per-value
  `bigint` allocation on the common path.

  **Migration:** a handler that did `bigint`-only arithmetic on a decoded value
  must coerce the argument, e.g. `const n = typeof v === "bigint" ? v : BigInt(v)`
  (to keep working in `bigint`) or `Number(v)` (to work in `number`, safe for
  values `≤ 2^53`). The encoder is unaffected — it already accepted
  `number | bigint` — so re-encoding a decoded value is byte-identical.

### Added

- `decode()` now runs a dedicated **contiguous fast-path decoder** that advances
  a single cursor over the whole buffer (the technique Protocol Buffers uses),
  instead of driving the resumable per-byte state machine. Same API and
  validation; markedly faster when the whole message is in hand. The streaming
  `IStream` remains for chunked input.
- Expanded the shared conformance suite to the 67-vector `test_vectors.json`,
  including the new `skip-ids` decode scenario (auto-skipping fields by id at any
  nesting depth, including whole nested sequences) and `requires`/`skip_ids`
  metadata.

### Performance

- **Decode:** number-first values + the contiguous fast path cut BigInt-builtin
  time from ~35% to ~4% and GC from ~10% to ~1% on small-value workloads. A
  `u32` array decodes ~2.2× faster streaming and ~2.6× faster contiguous
  (≈165 / ≈270 MB/s) for a number-consuming visitor. (#6)
- **Decode (streaming):** the resumable varint reader accumulates into two 32-bit
  number halves instead of doing a per-byte `bigint` shift, with no loss of
  64-bit fidelity.
- **Encode:** `encodeVarint` / `varintSize` split the 64-bit value into two
  32-bit number halves once and emit LEB128 with number-only arithmetic,
  dropping per-value `bigint` allocations from ~20 to 2. A full-range `u64`
  array encodes ~4.4× faster (≈14.5 → ≈64 MB/s, isolated); ids, lengths, counts
  and small scalars/arrays take a number fast path. (#5)

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: streaming, dependency-free TypeScript implementation of the
  SofaBuffers binary serialization format — `OStream` to encode and `IStream`
  (driving a `Visitor`) to decode, both chunkable, with a swappable acceleration
  `Kernel` seam.
